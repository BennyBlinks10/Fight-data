0,Paige Boet,2023-06-01,New Orleans to London,1.0,Trip Verified,The airline lost my luggage,"The airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip. They gave me no updates, their website sucks, and it was nearly impossible to get someone on the phone. They finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go back to the US, 5 days after I told them to ship it back to the US. Now, I’ve been calling everyday begging them to get my bag back to me. They appease me on the phone, tell me they’re fixing it, but nothing changes. The hotel can’t get in touch with them and they haven’t even tried to pick to bag back up. Several times, when I called I got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call back later”.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class
1,S Layne,2023-03-01,London to Amman,1.0,Trip Verified,fully refunded by our travel insurance,"We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits. We never once asked for a full refund - we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund. We will not use the credits - we were fully refunded by our travel insurance.",Couple Leisure,Business Class

4,Carol Willmore,2023-06-01,London to Funchal ,1.0,Not Verified,flight failed at every level,This flight failed at every level. We were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phoned to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a BA holiday. We pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound British Airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in Heathrow. As there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on Wednesday evening. Having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday. I might have expected a complimentary scone in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available. I would like to make it clear that we are British airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class
5,Nadine Kohler,2023-06-01,Marseille to Seattle via London Heathrow,1.0,Not Verified,BA refuses to make it right,"Beware of British Airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest. They won't treat you that way when you get bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes. We recently had a trip home planned from MRS to SEA. A mechanical issue meant that we departed late from MRS to LHR where we needed to make a connecting flight. We landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate, but a series of issues and choices by British Airways kept us from boarding our next plane. The crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5-10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines. Plus, we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed. We were pushed to Virgin Atlantic to figure out how to get us home. It extended our travel day by 8 hours! We were traveling with children as well. No offers of compensation or upgrades were made. And now BA is refusing to provide us any financial compensation. We paid for a trip home with only one connection and instead had two connections, multiple airlines to deal with, security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on. That is not what we paid for but BA refuses to make it right. So beware potential travelers!",Family Leisure,Economy Class
6,A. Adel,2023-06-01,Cairo to London ,2.0,Trip Verified,shame for such well known airline,I flew from Cairo to Heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat. Horrible service. I get to Heathrow airport 40 minutes late so I had to run around looking for my connecting flight. Finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate.

I waited 3 weeks for a ticket change. Call center workers are giving you false information just so they would make you hang up. They told me I was supposed to get an email from them with the flight changes, but never got. They don't have a live chat just like American Airlines do, they don't have a online form to submit your questions, they don t have a working international number.

Because of an accident by the airport, we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight. The kiosk was unable to read one of our passports and we had to go to check-in. The lady at the check-in checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass. Because we had no extra time, we headed straight to security and didn’t realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass (not of the passport holder). We got stuck in security because of that, couldn’t figure out what was wrong. We only didn’t miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party.

9,Jamie Gooding,2023-06-01,Dublin to London City,1.0,Trip Verified,so callous and uncaring,Flight at 8.40am from DUB to LCY cancelled 1155pm night before. No text message. No phone. Waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option. Hang on? What’s this! It was dark at 5am. It was hard to see mobile phone screen. I’m still jet lagged. Only option was to LHR at 9.20am. Tried calling. No one there. So accepted it. But I didn’t see the day change! It was the next day! I didn’t want the flight (as was staying at Docklands hence choosing LCY but thought I better take it as it’s leaving an hour after the original flight. Nope. I better call to say hey sorry I screwed up. Your flight is not going to work for me. I don’t have any more accommodation in Dublin and I don’t want to waste one night in London. Called. The most surly customer service (can you even be called that when you treat people like this) answered. She kept calling me James (not my name). She was brutal. You accepted it. I can’t do anything. She basically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion I accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer. She kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen. But if you had called us we could have put you onto a Aer Lingus flight! Why didn’t you call? You are at fault. Just so callous and uncaring. She wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees. I said nope and booked a flight today with Ryanair. Plus I need to find my way from Gatwick to Docklands. More money from me because of BA’s utter contempt for their passengers. I’ve been flying Qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff. But never this level of cruelty because of one simple error. Never again. How do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude? Welcome to the U.K.! Just wow.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class

11,K Pickering,2023-06-01,Seattle to Nice via London,1.0,Trip Verified,I will never fly British Airways again,"I booked our first out of country trip to take my husband on a surprise trip to Monaco. I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there. I will never fly British Airways again, and Delta’s baggage people are not doing great either.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class
12,V Samaras,2023-04-01,Athens to Durban via London Heathrow,2.0,Trip Verified,All flights without exception were delayed,"I went through three flights to reach my destination. All of my BA flights without exception were delayed, both on my way to my destination and back from my destination which is understandable to an extent. What's not understandable is that they weren't prepared for one of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so I ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling I had to wait and hope that the hotel would find an extra room since BA didn't communicate properly with them. I gave BA a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that I had the last flight with, which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints. I contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they didn't address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me. 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline together though.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

We were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to Barcelona, we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight.

Unfortunately I was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell I became. Also I could not find my way back home in my condition.

19,Alex Martinez,2023-05-01,Las Vegas to Venice,1.0,Not Verified,the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with,"My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me ""Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance."" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with ""my issues"". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

The food was so bad that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service. What happened to the really nice tea and scones? I've said this before after suffering through the BA concept of customer service (i.e. don't do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work) - this time i swear i mean it - never again on BA please!

The app would not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for COVID documents, but then did not accept them even when provided. I was trying to fly back to the USA, where I am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors. I went to British Airways Customer Service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger, even though I was there in plenty of time. This was also during an industrial action at Heathrow, meaning the number of flights were limited.

Could have made my connection in Heathrow if BA had been proactive. Instead, overnight at the Renaissance hotel compliments of BA. Adequate, but one wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers. If BA had offered one employee to help us get to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving, we could have made our flight and saved BA the cost of rebooking, hotel, shuttle, food accommodations.

After having our flight class reduced from First to Business, then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in First to make up for the disappointment, they then reneged on this. As it was a special anniversary it sucked. Flying back we checked in online to our chosen window seats, at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only. Trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats. Unbelievable! The flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable. This meant no pre-departure drinks and a limited selection of food. The crew was great but what an earth is going on at BA, they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time.

When I arrived at LAX one of my bags were missing. There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations. I don’t know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no one is willing to help me.

So many issues with getting from one destination to the other. Had an absolutely horrible time trying to get answers or reach anyone who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties. I wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight. Needless to say these will go to waste as I refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldn’t even address one single issue expressed to them. It was equivalent to handing me a band aid after slapping me in the face. I will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive. The most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss.,Family Leisure,Economy Class
31,Andrew Pybus,2023-04-01,Hong Kong to London,3.0,Trip Verified,they only had one choice of meal,"Due to code sharing with Cathay Pacific I was downgraded to BA on my return leg. I can’t describe how cheated I felt. I booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment, food and service, instead, I was forced to go hungry because they only had one choice of meal and it was inedible. To ensure the passengers didn’t get any funny ideas and assume that as the vegetarian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts. The cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “You won’t get anything else for 12 hours you know!” the entertainment is compiled mainly of B movies so I paid £11 for Wi-Fi so I could watch Netflix on my laptop. Unsurprisingly, the signal was so weak I couldn’t even send an email. To add insult to injury, the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality I have ever seen. Since the last time I used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful.

They are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls. I write an email an I am still waiting for 2 weeks!  Website is difficult to navigate. It is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service. They sent you online but you don't receive a PDF file. So if you need a proof of flight, you need to do screenshots. And, once the flight is flown, you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a PDF. You need to contact with a customer service which I did it online, long waiting time, and had to wait more than a week to receive it. Expensive and poor, almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website. An airline that definitely wouldn't recommend.

I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

To start, the plane was over 2 hours late, with no weather and no reason given. The boarding process was chaotic, both in the airport and onto the plane. But more importantly, although we were in business class, it wasn’t really business class. There were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no one sits there.

They made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that I paid previously. Or the second option they gave me is to get a refund of £80. (Tax only).

Getting the flight reinstated took multiple phone calls on both occasions. Each time needing to find a helpful representative. British Airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket. They tried to charge an $800 change fee. Through repeatedly calling back, British Airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6. To make sure it did not get changed again, i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15. It was intact those days. On 3/16 when it was time to check-in for the flight, it was gone.

47,R Worton,2023-03-01,London Heathrow to Munich,1.0,Trip Verified,a horror show of incompetence,"The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.",Family Leisure,Economy Class
48,Monica Cullen,2022-12-01,Prague to London,1.0,Trip Verified,what an absolute nightmare,"Back in December my family and I as we were getting onto the plane were refused. Even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused. It turns out that someone had not turned up to work and they couldn't let all the passengers on the plane. So quite randomly (not) 9 people were selected and turned away. We were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances, if I had connecting flights in London etc. I sought compensation from BA (which I was told I could do) and what an absolute nightmare this process has been. They wouldn't acknowledge my complaint for my family until I had an authorisation letter from them saying I could act on their behalf. Even though, I booked and paid for the tickets. So, I uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times. Every time they told me they received it and every time I followed it up they told me they hadn't. There was no other way except to post from Australia to the UK to some office. Eventually, it finally go through to them. I have now chased up the reimbursement four times. Each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient. Today they tell me that they need to check my account details. So, again, I send them the same information that I have done before. AND I wait patiently for my reimbursement. I am convinced that their business model is for you to get so frustrated you just go away. Well, you know what I won't.",Family Leisure,Economy Class

Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only.

On 12th January 2023 I booked a flight for my son and I to go to Alicante. However, I was informed on the 17th January 2023 by my doctors that I am unable to fly due to an elbow operation I have had. As a result I decided to give my ticket to my daughter, calling up the Customer Service team for British Airways to make the change. On the 18th January 2023 they took my enquiry call. There seemed to be some speech delay in the call, which presented a small bit of difficulty, however I also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay. When requesting to change the name on one of the tickets to my daughters name I was told this is not within the policy, and that I would need to cancel the ticket and rebook it. I was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers. I accepted this and was then asked if I would like to cancel the booking. I insisted I would need to know the total of the refund. It’s lucky I did ask to check this, as I was then informed it would be roughly £9.00. The total cost of my booking was £394.64, which comes to £197.32 per passenger, leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase. This is despite the seat not be abandoned. According to BA  policy, all I am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when I’m buying the ticket right back then and there on the phone (probably for more money than it was worth a week ago).",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves.

I flew with British Airline on August 21st 2022. I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

I assumed that my flight was canceled, but after more than 3 weeks, I still have not received any refund, so I reached out, and it turned out my flight is still on?! And it is getting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to BA. I tried multiple different ways, phone calls, and emails, but none was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty.

I was subsequently dumped at Barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor. There was no help at there to find a hotel. I have MS and can't walk without help, BA did nothing, their partners Iberia did nothing. At about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches. I lost my holiday, my hotel booking, and my music course. BA insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing. I would not have got on the plane had I known. I found out I could go to arbitration. BA now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if I do. Their policy of refusing all compensation for what would have been a dreadful experience for any passenger, is bad enough. For someone who is not mobile, it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of Duty of Care and towards Disabled Passengers.

The ticket was in premium economy. When I tried to upgrade to be with my broken- hearted sister, the price was $4029.00 plus a $25.00 service fee. Where is the efficiency? Where is the empathy? Where is the decency? In addition to the stress of losing her husband, my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight.

When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight.

I was booked onto a flight with BA for April 29th 2022 from Hong Kong to London. They cancelled the flight so I looked at rebooking for a later date; COVID ticketing flexibility assurances? Couldn't find a flight up to and including October. So I opted for the refund thinking I'd get a full refund. I was refunded about 1/5 of what I paid. I called their service centre for an explanation as I couldn't fathom how they could cancel the flight, not have any other flights available and I didn't get a full refund. Each phone call takes about 45 minutes before you get to talk to customer service. And thats where the frustration begins. The customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case. A month later and about 6 phone calls later, thats 6 hours waiting on the phone, they finally refunded me a little more - in total less than 1/4 of what I paid. It would seem to get a refund in increments I would have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until I got frustrated and give up. So instead of calling I enquired about this via their website .. just for an answer as to why I wasn't getting a full refund. I didn't cancel my booking, neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to HK. After another month of waiting ... this is the reason they gave in an email.

Minuses - The cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across. Each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space. It was hard to adjust the seat, particularly getting it to lie flat - even the FA found it difficult. The in-flight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films, TV programmes and music. The food choice and quality was poor - one of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor.

However, in my many attempts to receive communication from this company, it has been nothing but disappointment and upset.

After this he proceeded to tell me my bag was in Edmonton with WestJet, and that this was “not his problem”, before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold.

Then they lost our luggage, 4 days later they still don't have our luggage. Calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to anyone.

It was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated. She repeatedly asked if I needed anything as I had Arham in my lap most of the time. She held him whilst I had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft. We had a chat and the service was just amazing. It is something I will never forget.

We were booked to fly from ZHR-LHR on a miles ticket in February 2022. When we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we would have to pay for our baggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked baggage. We were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we would have to pay to check in our baggage. We have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed. As this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation. I tried contact BA Customer Services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didn’t bothered to respond. At the 3rd attempt, after I cc the CEO on my complaint I got a one line response saying that there was no free baggage included with our ticket. At this point I got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my baggage charge.

The flight was cancelled, a voucher was issued, another flight was booked using this voucher, and then again cancelled. After trying to use the voucher for a new flight, BA kept advising I couldn't as the voucher had been used. I asked them to check the status of that flight (as it never left) and the agent advised she didn't have access to that information. Two years in, I managed to speak to someone who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record. I then decided to pursue a refund, as felt this would be less problematic. BA have acknowledged they owe me a refund. One phone call they said it will be with me in 18 working days. I then chased when it was long overdue. I was then told it will be with me in 21 working days. The refund never came. I try regularly to get through to Customer Service for the automated system to advise no agents are available. I have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me, requesting an update, but with no response. Honestly feel very let down by BA who up until this, I felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline.

After a very long time, I got a cover letter which the bank sent to me, but then to be told I had missed the check in by 2 minutes. They would not let me board, and I missed the flight. So I contacted BA, and tried to rebook another departure flight, only to be told that because I missed my departing flight, my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was BA policy. So then they worked out a new price to book the flights, but now the price was £3500. I originally paid £1500 for the flights. I then did a search on Google and found flights for £1100, flying out with Air Mauritius and returning with BA on the same flight I was originally supposed to return on. Unfortunately BA had made me miss 2 days of my holiday, I searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on BA site that I needed the Insurance document.

On Twitter, I was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding. They just left my message unread. After about 6 hours of waiting for a Twitter DM back I ended up being able to find a chat line on their website. While talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she would book me a new seat, however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row. After a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat. Soon after I tried to pull up my booking in the British Airways app and was unable to find it. I would enter the booking reference and the site would say it was a success and the booking would show up once I refreshed the page but it did not. I continued to try and add the booking and the app would do the same thing every time, say it was a success then never add the booking.

Other times, they would purposely hang up after I stated my plight. IF I managed to persist through all of that, for hours on end, they would hang up purposely after ""needing"" to put me on hold once more to ""speak with their supervisor.""

To help us out the email said, they had however booked us on another flight leaving from London City Airport, which is 26 miles from Heathrow Airport and the flight is going to Edinburgh, not Glasgow. Not sure how we were supposed to get from Glasgow, additionally it is in economy, not business class even though we had booked business class originally. We booked this as one connecting flight so British Airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from Australia. There was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in getting to another airport, nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for British Airways.

As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris.

We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy.

123,C Layne,2022-03-01,London Heathrow to Funchal,4.0,Trip Verified,I couldn’t check in online,"We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time.

I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket.

The fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and European destinations on the evening of Saturday 19 February for operational reasons was pitiful. You could not rebook via BA’s website. Instead passengers were compelled to queue at Gate A17 at LHR to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight.

While the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at Heathrow are useless. First time in February 2020 I got stuck in Heathrow due to Storm Ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault. However the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke. They had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to get through everyone quicker. Their was no crowd control and at one point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop. In the end after a 12 hour battle I was lucky enough to get home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when I finally spoke to someone. In November 2021 I decided to give BA a second chance and booked to go to New York. Since the plane landed late into LHR I missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at Heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while. As I rushed through customs I did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight. My layover was now 10 hours and all I got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a phone number for what I thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints. Considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap. A few days after I got home I then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed I was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working. When I got a response I said I wanted 20-25% back off my holiday. I got an apology and told the staff at Heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation I was offered nothing!,Solo Leisure,Economy Class
133,Sonto Mtolo,2022-01-01,Durban to Cape Town,10.0,Trip Verified,staff was very kind and friendly,"I used British Airways for the first time and I have to admit that I am impressed with their service! Firstly, I want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage. My flight was 16:10, however due to unforeseen circumstances, I arrived at the airport around 15:40. I was convinced that I was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long. I stood there a few minutes but then realized that I would miss my flight. I went to ""Club check-in"" and the lady was incredibly kind to me. I just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though I was at fault. She weighed my luggage and I was able to board the flight successfully. I was not aware that this airline gives out free meals. We got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vegetarian and chicken. I personally love free stuff so I will be ditching Flysafair (even though they have excellent service as well) in the near future, unfortunately. Diversity; The first time I flew was in 2018 and I have to admit that I have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with British Airways it was different.  The staff was very kind and friendly as well. What a wonderful experience to fly with these guys!",Solo Leisure,Economy Class
134,G Thanidhar,2022-01-01,Bangalore to Detroit via London,1.0,Trip Verified,complete disregard for your passengers,"I recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on British Airways from Detroit to Bangalore and back. Given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers, I decided to spend extra and get a business class ticket. I was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that I was special because I spent that extra money or was in Business class. From shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff, I experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys. The trump was being stranded in London having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to get to the front of the counter to rebook my flight. Being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in one gigantic line and wait our turn. Some special passengers were escorted to the Club World check in. When we asked the lady, she told us to continue standing where we were and she would come back to get us when the counter freed up. Needless to say it never did. Finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked. So I come back to the question: Can big corporations lie with no accountability? Why would I spend my hard-earned money on something that gave me nothing extra? Shame on you British Airways for your complete disregard for your passengers. Stop your lying or update your promises!",Solo Leisure,Business Class
135,M Kalsiman,2021-10-01,London to Dubai,1.0,Trip Verified,doors cannot close till take off,"Straightforward and friendly baggage drop. On to South Lounge, no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before, no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 1.5m distancing. Had to roam the entire lounge, lugging our bags on the carpeted floor, with no success at all. Gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge. Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used. It was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket. Naive to trust claims of world class standards.",Couple Leisure,Business Class

Once we finally found the check-in desks, luggage drop and check-in was appalling. It took us over 1.5 hours to get our bags checked (and we were half way through the queue). The whole process was disorganised and very slow, really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small, impatient kids. Lady in Warsaw Airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless. One check-in desk for Euro Traveller / Club Europe, one for bag drop and one for the check-in.

139,L Deane,2021-07-01,Singapore to London,1.0,Trip Verified,"whole experience was stressful, costly","I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task.

Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was.

This is not a case of me being snobby, but simply a point of principle and a clear case of BA mis-selling. Had I known prior that I would be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight, I wouldn’t have booked.

Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight.

It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier.

167,Nikol Firdzhanova,2020-12-01,London to Cairo,10.0,Trip Verified,I do want to thank BA,"I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in",Solo Leisure,Economy Class
168,Victoria Huber,2020-10-01,London to Venice,9.0,Not Verified,my experience with BA was very positive,"Overall I have to say I am really pleased with the service BA provided, given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines. I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

I needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel ban to Europe that began in March. I was able to change my flight at no cost, which is great, but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel ban began, those tickets should have been refunded. If I were to have boarded that flight, I would have been quarantined in Europe and would have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re-entry to the US IF I were able to return at all. The fact that British Airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since I do not know who in their right mind would have traveled to Spain with the travel ban enforced.

177,E Partani,2020-03-01,Sydney to London via Singapore,1.0,Trip Verified,never use this airline again,"I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.

Thankfully the one person I had briefly spoken to in the Duty office that night then emailed me back and I was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight. This change took about 10-15 minutes over a few emails. But the person helping me couldn’t extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected. The only way this could be managed would be by myself calling the car hire company.

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between.

If you want to get anything from your bag below the seat in front of you, you will need to do some major maneuvering. Touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable. I flew on a 747 both ways. They no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm. I had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways. I was literally sweating.

After the flight landed, I rushed to the baggage claim because my wife and I had another flight out of London and only had an hour to make it. Even though we could see the plane and watch the baggage crew drive the bags over, it took 45 minutes before my bag came through. The baggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive, by which time I was running to catch my next flight on a different airline, which I missed. Turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasn’t for another 6 days. Hoping that British Airways would help us in some way, we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent, basically told us to pound sand.

I then cancelled my BA flight, but they only refunded £159 of the £187 I had paid. The £28 difference was picking my seats. How do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight?

It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class

Cheapest goodies bag with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane. I had already been to the BA desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt. First class out to HK was a good business class experience, the return flight in business class was in a word poor. The plane was tired, IFE faulty, poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff, they were lovely - but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish.

Last year I went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to New Orleans from London on the holiday of a life time. I was pregnant at the time. The baby died while I was on holiday there and I was in a turmoil of emotions.

Somehow I missed the flight back. I have no excuse for this. When I realised I was in a complete state. I had a break down. I rang BA and sobbed down the phone. They were beyond amazing!

235,Andrew Miao,2019-08-01,Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London ,2.0,Trip Verified,service was totally unacceptable,"Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class

We were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go. Eventually got off the plane to utter chaos - mixed messages being given by ground crew. Some people given details about rebooking, others given nothing. Some people were sent texts with rebooking options, others (including me) received nothing. Vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels - however some people were only given one bus voucher, meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day!

Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided.

My flight to Nice was cancelled as a result of the low-cost and unreliable IT system that BA have, while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs. The handling of the situation at Heathrow was despicable, and you would think that with all the failures that BA encounter these days, they would have got this part of their act together. They make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue, when clearly they have not been investing where they should, instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses.

However, into the flight I found one female crew very personable and was offered a seat two back. I was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet, so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available, and I needed to ask for a pillow. The menu guide was on cheap paper and, with no convenient place to store it for reference later, was very ordinary. The evening meal was acceptable (soup, steak/veg, fruits ) was OK served with freezing cold cutlery. Bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles, asthma puffer, or water bottle. The breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber ball and the included fish patties were unpalatable. The lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight. Overall I expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery. The only business class addition feature that I appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep.

When you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class, at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers. This was nothing but a waste of money. I doubt very much I will go back to British Airways again.",Solo Leisure,First Class
284,C Dean,2019-03-01,Tenerife to Heathrow,2.0,Trip Verified,Effectively a budget airline,"Tenerife to Heathrow. Effectively a budget airline masquerading at premium airline prices. Have flown several budget airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for money and service. Seats are rigid and I felt as if I was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight. When I tried to put my seat back to recline, I estimate it moved around 5 degrees. Leg room is also non existent. M&S food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apologetic, for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how badly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons. Furthermore, several other budget airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers. BA again in a move to save money opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals. Can't fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the BA brand. They are professional, friendly and courteous. It's clear that British Airways are not the airline they once were and I hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline back to its former glory.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class

The flight departs at 2037. I went to the ground crew of American Airlines, they told me that I will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway. They then directed me to British Airways. I went to the ground attendant of British Airways and she told me to go back to American Airlines to get it re booked. I went back to American Airlines then they told me again to back to British Airways since they are they the one who caused the delay. I went back to British Airways with the American Airlines supervisor. The British Airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning. She did not offer any explanations or anything. American Airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation.

In the beginning everything went normal and smooth. Check-in and boarding was easy and on time and once everyone boarded the problems started one after another. First an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in Heathrow (fair enough). Afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage. After that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at Schiphol Airport and they are doing their best to resolve it. This caused us already about 45-60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started. We received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane. Of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and I guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave. The crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave. So a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off. Then the pilot announced that we can take off after 2,5 or 3 hours. The flight was full of overseas travellers. We spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere, people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us. We had to line up next to the bathroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it.

They wouldn't allow me to swap my ticket with my husband as we were traveling with my kids and I had a slight delay which meant I couldn't go on the same flight.

Nothing could be done for us, and they could only rebook us for $8800. No apologies whatsoever were given, nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in Rome.

BA managed everything in a very professional manner. The bag-drop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules. The cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video. During this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression. I had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class

We are strict vegans so pre-booked vegan meals for our flight. Meals were delivered as usual, and had the vegan slip on them, but as I was about to start eating I noticed that I had been given butter - this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal. When I called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was, informing me that there was no meat in it. I had to explain to her what a vegan was (i.e; no dairy or eggs). It turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it. Needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals. Shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley, so we asked for a coffee with Soya Milk - the staff to whom I had had to explain what a vegan was said ""oh I don't think we have that, but we have semi skimmed milk"". I had to re-explain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she would go and ask. When she returned she said 'We don't provide that sort of thing."" That was strange, because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did. So we had no meals, no hot drinks, and our video screen did not work. The Customer Service that followed from was more appalling, they could not care less, it took ages to get replies and when i did I was just palmed off. After several months of having to write emails I was informed that I had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper, which was just another way of getting rid of us. So we did this, after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation - basically the value of the meals that we could not eat - in vouchers.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class

No smile, no 'Hello' or 'Good morning'. Hardly any eye contact either. If anything, the situation was worse at boarding. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. All such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class

How dare BA do this to me when I was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work (different airlines) until I encountered BA at Heathrow. Check-in and help desk are arrogant, rude and are as miserable as hell. Not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat. we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from BA. British Airways is a disgrace of an airline, because they have a monopoly on the Heathrow slots they think they can get a way with such disgraceful service, well, they are wrong, like others I have found an alternative airline.

I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don’t want any particular seat. We are travelling as a pair. There are three seats each side of the aisle. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don’t know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit.

The entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they didn't inform the customers about it. Some of the flight attendants were unprofessional.

I expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food, better seat and a larger entertainment screen I really didn't see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost. The staff weren't that attentive so I felt like I got one much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left alone until an hour before the end of the flight.

The woman at the counter asked me where I was going and when I said Montreal, she looked at me and said ""you won't make it"". I explained the situation how I had been in the airport for several hours already and that I was in line for 1 hour. She just told me I needed to go to the missed flight counter. I got to the counter and they informed me that I had to buy a new return ticket. My original return ticket cost me $800, my return cost me $1350.  I had no choice but to buy the ticket. I also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to Gatwick airport the following morning. Once I arrived back in Montreal I called BA Customer Services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket, and that I could get a refund, if not for the new flight, then for the $400 of the flight I missed.

The bag-drop in Naples was slow and seemed rather random. Boarding was tedious. I should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card. In the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed. Boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage. The cabin crew were quite indifferent. I greeted 2 cabin crew when I boarded and neither of them smiled back. I bought a Marks and Spencer drink at an inflated price. One of the crew moved my small bag in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when I went to collect my bag it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger.

The cabin crew were very nice, he apologised and passed me a feedback form which I have filled in. While I understand that this airline does not want to waste food (and I liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need), it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours.

There were many drinks available, wine was ok. I tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and none of the plugs seemed to be working, this was also disappointing. With regards to the service on board the flight, it was ok, however, they collected my breakfast card, but not my husbands, so he nearly missed out on breakfast, the next morning, they offered my husband a bread roll, but not me, it seemed there was not much structure to the service, which meant they missed things.

I was downgraded as BA overbook their flight by 10%. Their offer of compensation was £200! I am also waiting almost one month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class. This experience has caused undue stress and at this point I am reluctant to use their services in the future.

We booked our flight tickets directly on BA site since July 2017 for the travelling date of December 24, 2017. One day before our travel, we processed the online check-in and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight (BKK > LHR) without prior notice through any communication channels (email, sms text) by BA. After many attempts to find a solution, it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in Thailand. However, we managed to talk to the customer services team in UK. She informed us that due to the connecting flight from LHR to LIS was cancelled by BA, the airline had removed our names from the entire trip (2 sectors). The assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added back to the BKK > LHR flight if we (by ourselves) could find a connecting flight from LHR to LIS. The only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets. Unfortunately, there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only one choice - to accept the refund to our tickets (without offering any other help). Our intention is to seek for proper explanation from BA in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers. We had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check-in online 24 hours before the flight. If we had went to check-in counter directly on our departure date, we would be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled.  We were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but BA's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers. Finally, we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on Christmas eve. I find it inexcusable for a world-class airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on one of the most important day & holiday of the entire year. This event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending, but left us with one of the worst flying experiences.

I could get a refund on the return portion my flight, which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re-book. Or they could fly me into Seattle on Tuesday and I must make my way home from there on my own dime, and I could submit for reimbursement from BA - no guarantees they will reimburse though. I was told when BA cannot get you to your home destination, their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country, and forces me to clear customs there and at home.

When we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 2.5 hours turn around time and we would have to collect our baggage from re claim and check in again. we pointed out that this would certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to Costa Rica it was unlikely that there would be a suitable alternate flight that day and we would lose a day of our holiday waiting around in Madrid airport.

In order to get this new flight I had to be at JFK Airport at 1:45 pm. To make this happen, I had to skip all last minute arrangements. The flight from Charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to London. Our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours.

Yesterday 6th January our flight had been rescheduled from 18.30 for 11am today, due to technical problems which they couldn't fix that night. After a fair amount of announcements it was decided we would be put up at the Hilton hotel next door. So we all had to go back to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the BA desk to collect our vouchers. We duly went along to the Hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us - by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained, especially those with small children. The desk staff told us they were trying to phone BA to ask what to do with the rest of us but were getting no answer from them. So at this stage my husband and I decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi back to London safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th January. We duly left home this morning at 8am to get here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 18.30 tonight. Oh dear BA, why couldn't you let us all know this by sending an email with a phone number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night? Just too efficient for you I guess. So we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do, no problem BA we didn't mind forking out another £5 to cover it.

All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline.

For some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under someone else's name and to a different destination. I was flying from London to Montreal and my suitcase was sent to Dublin. First guy I talked on the phone, after a week of no news at all, he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken. Were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something? In theory, he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to Montreal. But after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing, I decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase, was still in Dublin. A second email, was sent to get my suitcase send it to me. A couple of days after and of course, with no news at all from them, I decided to call them back again. This time my suitcase wasn't in Dublin, it was sent to London Heathrow and they lost it again at that airport. This guy, asked me to call them back, Monday morning London time, so I did. I called back again on Monday morning, and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his London team, he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase, when I had done that same day I placed the delayed luggage report. Don't they have all this info in file?. After telling him that I did that, first day, he then asked me to call them back in 48h again. I'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase. No compensation was mentioned to me, even that I had to buy clothes and some other items that I already had in my suitcase. Lucky enough, this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip, otherwise they would make my vacation quiet miserable. I understand, there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to get what's yours. I think this whole experience would have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time, I would have get a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me.

We should have had a two hour lay-over for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to San Francisco and were told at disembarkation that we had been re-routed via Washington! Our booked flight to San Francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push back. We finally got on the Washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from Amsterdam to catch the flight. The delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at Heathrow thus delaying the flight further. We eventually arrived in Washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight - there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available. Obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour (around about 23.00) trying to find help at the check-in desk in a practically empty airport. United (acting on behalf of BA) checked us onto a flight the following morning and the BA staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away. Ironically, the BA personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from Amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us! We were also downgraded to economy on the flight between Washington and San Francisco as business class was full. We eventually got to San Francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival. BA offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down-grade in class. They did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre-booked (but unused) hotel in San Francisco.

I can't say the same for the rest of our trip. We found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats together for a 6.5 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats. The neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats, originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped. We arrived into London around 9am. late of course, and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection, we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security. The BA representative told us the next flight was full and we would have to wait until 5pm. We again explained that we were on our honeymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in Rome. The BA representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight - so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to get into Rome for dinner. Upon our return flights, we attempted three times to reserve seats online via British Airways app and web (learning from before) and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my PayPal account. We eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home, though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to London. Once we arrived at Rome to check - we got hit with the $100 additional baggage fee (we we tried to explain, the representative refused to comp the bag). Upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra bag that was not paid for. Luckily, we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier. Otherwise I imagine we would've had to shell out $100 again. We are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home, as we are again delayed on our flight from Rome to London. If you fly British Airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class
